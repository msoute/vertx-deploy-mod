# Introduction

Tooling to deploy Vert.X applications, generic artifacts and (application) configuration onto cloud based instances (Ec2).

# Installation / Configuration

## Docker
for deploy mod 3.0.5
`docker run --net=[networkname] --name vertx-deploy msoute/vertx-deploy:3.0.5`
for the latest
`docker run --net=[networkname] --name vertx-deploy msoute/vertx-deploy:devel`

## Installation.
Install as any other application with max 1 verticle instance.
Init.d scripts are provided for Red Hat and debian based systems. install as vertx (debian|redhat.vertx) and vertx-deploy (debian|redhat.vertx.deploy).
Place defaults in /etc/defaults/vertx and configure as needed.

The configured system user needs sudo access to the init.d vertx script and any (test) command. The user also needs write access to directories configured for artifacts

*note* Prior to Vert.x 3.2.1 a custom distribution needs to be used since the maven service factory depended on an older version of httpclient.

## Configuration

    {
        "vertx.home":"/opt/sw/vertx/current",
        "artifact.storage": "/opt/data/repo/",
        "http.authUser": "...",
        "http.authPass": "...",
        "maven.repo.uri": "...",
        "aws.region", "eu-west-1",
        "aws.as.register.maxduration":10,
    }
    
* **vertx.home** : The Vertx installation directory. (required)
* **vertx.run** : Dir where the applications writes state files for currently deployed applications (default {vertx.home}/run/)
* **artifact.storage** : Directory to download (config) artifacts to. (required)
* **http.authUser** : Nexus repo user 
* **http.authPass** : Nexus repo password
* **maven.repo.uri*** : Maven repo url
* **maven.repo.snapshot.policy**  : Maven snapshot policy (default: always)
* **config.location** : Location of config file (used for -conf when a verticle is instantiated)
* **service.config.location** : Location of the defaults file per service (default: /etc/default)
* **aws.region** : The Aws region
* **aws.as.register.maxduration** : maximum (de)register duration in minutes (default:4)
* **vertx.default.java.opts** : Default java opts passed to the application with --java-opts (default "")
* **vertx.clustering** : (boolean) Enables -cluster
* **aws.as.autodiscover** (boolean) Enables auto discovery of artifacts that need to be deployed (default false)

# Deploy configuration 
## Deploy artifacts.
The plugin uses the projects pom to determine what artifacts need to be deployed. There are three types of artifacts (in the order of deployment)
* config : configuration files, unpacked to a specified location
* static artifacts : static content, sites etc that are extracted to a specified location on the target host
* applications : Vert.x applications.

To instruct the plugin to deploy an artifact (application, artifact or config) it only needs to be added as a dependency to the pom.xml. The plugin ignores all dependencies specified in parent poms or transitive.

### Vert.x Application artifact
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>[groupId]</groupId>
        <artifactId>[artifactId]</artifactId>
        <version>[version]</version>
    </dependency>
    ...

Applications are started using the vert.x CLI start method. all non config or static artifacts are regarded as vert.x applications.

### Config artifact

    <dependency>
        <groupId>[groupId]</groupId>
        <artifactId>[artifactId]</artifactId>
        <version>[version]</version>
        <classifier>[classifier]</version>
        <type>config</type>
    </dependency>

These artifacts will be unpacked to the location specified in artifact_context.xml (See appendix creating an artifact). Always before static artifacts or applications
identified by type config

### Static artifact

    <dependency>
        <groupId>[groupId]</groupId>
        <artifactId>[artifactId]</artifactId>
        <version>[version]</version>
        <classifier>site</version>
        <type>zip</type>
    </dependency>

These artifacts will be unpacked to the location specified in artifact_context.xml (See appendix creating an artifact). Always after config artifacts and before applications
identified by classifier site

## Maven Plugin Configuration

    ...


### DeployConfigurations

Multiple targets can be configured. The target configuration can be selected with *-Ddeploy.target=*

#### Default Deploy Configuration Options
* **target** : The target id
* **hosts** : List of hosts to deploy to. This property is ignored when deploying when either  *useOpsWorks* or *useAutoScaling* is true
* **deployConfig** : Indicates if config artifacts should also be deployed (default : *true*)
* **exclusions** : List of artifacts that should be ignored 
* **testScope** : Include artifacts in test scope (default : *false*) 
* **restart** : Restart whole container or only deployed applications (default : *false*)
* **deploySnapshots** : Also deploy -SNAPSHOT artifacts (default : *false*)


#### Aws Configuration Options
* **awsPrivateIp** : Use public or private ip's to connect to deploy application. (default : *false*)
* **UseOpsWorks** : Use OpsWorks (Layers) to detect instances to deploy to. Cannot be use icw *useAutoScaling*. (default : *false*)    
* **useAutoScaling** : Use auto scaling groups to detect instances to deploy to. Cannot be used icw *useOpsWorks*. (default : *false*)    
* **elb** : When true the deploy application with wait for instances to come InService on attached elb's before continuing deploy. (default : *false*)

#### Aws AutoScaling Configuration Options
* **autoScalingGroupId** : The auto scaling group to get the list of instances from, can be a regex.
* **ignoreInStandby** : When true, any instance that is in standby in the auto scaling group will also be added as host to deploy to. InStandby instances will always be deployed to first. (default : *true*)
* **decrementDesiredCapacity** Decrement configured desired capacity with 1 to make sure that configured policies won't launch a new instance (default : *true*)
* **maxCapacity** : If Strategy is KEEP_CAPACITY, the capacity of the group wil never grow greater than **maxCapacity**. Defaults to max capacity in configured in auto scaling group.
* **minCapacity** : If Strategy is GUARANTEE_MINIMUM and a deploy failed the build wil also fail if the capacity drops under the configured minimum. (default : *1*)
* **deployStrategy** : The deploy strategy to use. Valid values are *KEEP_CAPACITY*, *GUARANTEE_MINIMUM*, *WHATEVER* *SPIN_AND_REMOVE*. (default: *KEEP_CAPACITY)
* **spindown** : If strategy is SPIN_AND_REMOVE, keep the instance alive after deployment if false (default: true)

#### CloudWatch metrics
* **metricNamespace** : The CloudWatch namespace to use *required to enable metrics*
* **metricApplication** : The Application name *required to enable metrics*
* **metricEnvironment** : The Application environment *optional*

#### Auto Scaling deploy strategies.
* **KEEP_CAPACITY** : The deploy applications wil make sure the auto scale capacity wil not drop during the deploy. Before a deploy an extra instances will be added to the auto scaling group if the desired count is smaller than the auto scaling group
configured maximum. If *maxCapacity** is configured the desired count wil never be greater than **maxCapacity**. If *elb** is true the current InService count wil be based on the number of instances InService on the elb(s), otherwise the healthy instance count in the elb is used. 
* **DEFAULT** : The deploy applications wil only deploy if the  InService count is greater than the groups minimum count. The deploy wil never continue after a failed deploy. The deploy mod
wil not guarantee at least one InService instance (i.e. if the groups minimum count is 0 with one InService instance)
* **GUARANTEE_MINIMUM** : The deploy applications does not care if a single instance deploy fails. As long as the InService count never drops below **minCapacity**. With **elb** the InService count on the elb wil be used. Otherwise the auto scaling group healthy count.
* **SPIN_AND_REMOVE** : Spins a new instance if there are 0 instances in the autoscaling group. Removes the instance after deploy

* **WHATEVER** : Kittens may die (a.k.a. you don't care, so we don't either, the application may go offline.)
Note : When there are no InService instances (elb or auto scaling group) on start of the deploy the strategy wil set to **WHATEVER**

#### Aws OpsWorks Configuration Options
* **String opsWorksLayerId** : The layer id to get a list of instances from.

### Mojos
General Mojo parameters

* **deploy.activeTarget** : selects the target configuration
* **deploy.requestTimeout** : overwrites the default timeout (in minutes)

#### mvn deploy:deploy

The default mojo. Based on configuration it wil deploy to a set of configured instances, instances in an OpWorks layer or instances in an auto scaling group.
When deploying to an OpsWorks based set of instances the deploy application can be configured to wait for every instance to come InService on an elb before continuing.

During deploys to an auto scaling group the plugin wil first try to deploy Standby instances and put those back into service. This can be overridden with **ignoreInStandby**

 When an instance is put InStandby for deployment it wil decrement the desired capacity of the auto scaling group with 1. This can be overridden (  **decrementDesiredCapacity** ). Note that an
auto scaling group will always try to conform to the configured desired amount i.e. it wil launch a new instance.

 Note : During a deploy to an auto scaling group the deploy application temporarily suspends the following auto scaling policies : *ScheduledActions* , *Terminate* and *ReplaceUnhealthy*. These processes are resumed
after the deploy finished (or fails). If the maven task is killed during the deploy those processes are not automatically. This can be fixed either by running a new deploy or with the AWS CLI  

 Note : The plugin assumes that a deploy is ready when an instance reaches the status *InService* on all elb's or when no elb's are attached in the auto scaling group. The default ELB health check
does not guarantee any application to be ready and listening. A custom elb health-check needs to be [configured](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-healthchecks.html). 

Maven options :

#### mvn deploy:deploy-direct

Deploys to a single instance. For example when an instance comes online tools like puppet can instruct a remote Jenkins instance to schedule a build to deploy a set of modules to the newly created instance. 
This mojo ignores **deploy.activeTarget** 

* **deploy.remoteIp** : The Ip to deploy to *required* .
* **deploy.testScope** : Include test artifacts  (default : *false*)
* **deploy.withConfig** : Include config artifacts (default : *true*)

####  mvn deploy:deploy-single
Deploys a single artifact to a DeployTarget 

* **deploy.single.type** : artifact type *required*
* **deploy.single.groupId** : The artifact groupId *required*
* **deploy.single.artifactId** : The artifactId *required*
* **deploy.single.classifier** : The artifact classifier 
* **deploy.single.version** : The artifact version *required*

#### mvn deploy-single-as
Deploys to an autoscaling group
mvn target options (-D):

* **deploy.auth.token** :
* **deploy.exclusions** :
* **deploy.as.id** :
* **deploy.as.strategy** :
* **deploy.as.private** :
* **deploy.as.elb** :
* **deploy.as.test** :
* **deploy.as.config** :
* **deploy.as.restart** :
* **deploy.as.decrement** :
* **deploy.as.stickiness** : Enables stickiness during deploy (default: *false*)
* **deploy.as.allowSnapshots** :

* **deploy.as.properties** : See Autodiscover deploys

* **deploy.metrics.namespace** : The CloudWatch namespace to use *required to enable metrics*
* **deploy.metrics.application** : The Application name *required to enable metrics*
* **deploy.metrics.environment** : The Application environment *optional*

### mvn deploy:as-enable
Mojo to add one instance to an as_group if current instances size equals 0.
* **autoScalingGroupId** : The auto scaling group to enable. 

## Vert.X Module Configuration


# Examples

## Deploy to multiple instances in an auto-scaling group with ELB support.
The following target configuration wil deploy to all instances in the as-group *autoscaling-group-id* and check if each instance reached the inService status
on the ELB's it is a member of. If the instance does not reach the inService status within 5 minutes the build wil fail and the remaining instances wil nog be updated

    <deployConfiguration>
        <target>[target]</target>
        <testScope>false</testScope>
        <restart>true</restart>
        <elb>true</elb>
        <autoScaling>true</autoScaling>
        <autoScalingGroupId>autoscaling-group-id</autoScalingGroupId>
    </deployConfiguration>

# Creating (config) artifacts.
Artifacts other than vert.x applications can be constructed in a similar way by using the maven-assembly-plugin. These artifacts are extracted on the targeted instance. A
config file in the artifact root dir (artifact_context.xml) instructs the application where and how to extract the artifact.

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <artifact>
        <baselocation>...</baselocation>
        <testCommand>...</testCommand>
        <restartCommand>...</restartCommand>
        <checkContent>true|false</checkContent>
    </artifact>
    
* **baselocation** : Instructs the application where to extract the artifact. All existing dir's and / or files wil be removed first *required*
* **testCommand** : Runs a console command after extraction, if the command failed the build wil fail (i.e. nginx -t)
* **restartCommand** : Command to restart a service after extraction, runs after testCommand (i.e. service nginx restart)
* **checkContent** : Checks if the content in an artifact has changed (i.e. property file content) and forces a container restart.

# Service Configuration files
 During startup of a service a per service config file is read to overide / set per service config variables. The Directory in which these config files reside can be configured
 with **config.location**. The config files are matched by [groupId]:[artifactId] or [groupId]~[artifactId]. The config file is in default properties format.

 If an config option exists it wil override the configured default.

* **JAVA_OPTS** : JVM_OPTS for the verticle (--java-opts)
* **INSTANCES** : The number of verticle instances to start (--instances)
* **MAIN_SERVICE** : The deploy application expects the service descriptor in the jar to match the maven coordinates. If this is not the case a custom service name can be configured ([groupId]:[artifactId]:[version]::[MAIN_SERVICE])
* **CONFIG_FILE** : A per service config file (-conf)

# Phone Home

Applications deployed through the deploy application should report to the deploy application if de deploy was successful or failed. All verticles can do this by
sending a request to http://localhost:[port]/deploy/update?id=[id]&status=[ok|error]&errormessage=[message]

The deploy application adds an JVM property that indicates on what port the deploy application is running (vertxdeploy.port)

If an application reports an error the deploy wil fail, the same error is reported back to the maven pluging.

# Auto(scaling)discover deploys
If autoscaling is setup the deploy application can try to auto-discover what needs to be deployed on initial run. In order to do this the maven plugin
  will store all needed data (version, scope) as a tag on the autoscaling group. The deploy application wil read these tags and create a deploy command.

## deploy.as.properties

Comma separated list of build options that who's values are stored in order to execute an autodiscover deploy.
i.e. If a build uses a propertie ${target.env} in its pom the resovled value needs to be persisted to an autoscaling group tag in order for an autodiscover deploy
to deploy the exact same version.
